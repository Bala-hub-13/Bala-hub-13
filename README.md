# Hey, I'm Bala.

Not much to say.  
Just finished an undergrad in biosciences. Now, I’m figuring out computational biology.  
If you’re looking for someone with all the answers, that’s not me. I like to let the science (and sometimes the code) do the talking.

---

### What I’m doing

- Solving problems on [Rosalind](http://rosalind.info/) and using Galaxy  
- Mixing biology with computation  
- Learning as I go, not in a rush to “master” anything

---

### Things I actually enjoy

- Reading (books, articles, whatever catches my interest)
- Playing guitar when I feel like it
- Thinking about science—sometimes writing about it, sometimes not

---

### What’s next?

Who knows.  
I’ll probably keep exploring computational biology and see what happens.  
Not big on social links or self-promotion, but if you like bio stuff or code, you might find something interesting here.

Thanks for stopping by, I guess.
